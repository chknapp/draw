Welcome to the DRAW project 

The DRAW library helps
to realize a 2D visualisation from within source code. 

1. Library dependencies

- the DRAW library relies on a working installation of OpenGL and glfw
        http://www.glfw.org/download.html
  (If you experience linker problems with glfw be sure you add the correct 
   libraries for your system in the Makefile in the GLFLAGS/LIBS variable.)

- the device_window needs CUDA-5.0 ( and thrust which is included), 
        https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

2. Library documentation
The library comes with a documentation that can be 
created using Doxygen ( http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ ) via:
    doxygen Doxyfile 
that will create a doc/ subdirectory.
Open with
    firefox doc/html/index.html
